# Issue tracker: GitLab

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitLab issues. Use the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

Never paste an issue description or note into the command line. It is Markdown, and inside double quotes or an unquoted heredoc the shell runs every backtick span and `$()` in it. Write it to a file in a temporary directory with the file-writing tool, then pass it as `"$(cat <file>)"`: command substitution inserts the file's text as is. Single-quote titles.

- **Create an issue**: `glab issue create --title '...' --description "$(cat <file>)"`.
- **Read an issue**: `glab issue view <number> --comments`. Use `-F json` for machine-readable output.
- **List issues**: `glab issue list -F json` with appropriate `--label` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `glab issue note <number> --message "$(cat <file>)"`. GitLab calls comments "notes".
- **Apply / remove labels**: `glab issue update <number> --label "..."` / `--unlabel "..."`. Multiple labels can be comma-separated or by repeating the flag.
- **Close**: `glab issue close <number>`. `glab issue close` does not accept a closing comment, so post the explanation first as a note, then close.
- **Merge requests**: GitLab calls PRs "merge requests". Use `glab mr create`, `glab mr view`, `glab mr note`, etc., the same shape as `gh pr ...` with `mr` in place of `pr` and `note`/`--message` in place of `comment`/`--body`.

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `glab` does this automatically when run inside a clone.
